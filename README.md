# Algerian Forest Fires Analysis

## Overview

This project involves the analysis of a dataset related to forest fires in Algeria. The goal is to explore the data, perform preprocessing, and gain insights into the factors contributing to forest fires. This project may also include predictive modeling to identify fire-prone areas or conditions.

## Project Structure

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading**:

   - The dataset (`Algerian_forest_fires_cleaned_dataset.csv`) is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:

   - Summary statistics and data structure information.
   - Visualization of features and their relationships using tools like Seaborn and Matplotlib.

3. **Data Preprocessing**:

   - Dropping irrelevant columns such as `day`, `month`, and `year`.
   - Converting categorical labels (e.g., `Classes`) into numerical values.

4. **Feature Engineering**:

   - Transformations or additional computations to enhance the dataset's usability.

5. **Modeling (if applicable)**:

   - Applying machine learning models to predict or analyze fire-prone conditions.

6. **Results**:

   - Key insights from the analysis and model performance metrics.

## Prerequisites

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

To install the required libraries, use:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the notebook file.
2. Ensure the dataset (`Algerian_forest_fires_cleaned_dataset.csv`) is in the same directory as the notebook.
3. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Algerian_forest_fires.ipynb
   ```
4. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features related to forest conditions, weather, and fire occurrence in Algeria. Key attributes include:

- **Temperature**: Daily temperature values.
- **Rainfall**: Precipitation levels.
- **Humidity**: Atmospheric moisture content.
- **Wind Speed**: Speed of the wind in the region.
- **Classes**: Indicates the presence (`fire`) or absence (`not fire`) of forest fires.

## Insights and Findings

- Distribution of fire and non-fire instances.
- Correlation between meteorological conditions and fire occurrence.
- Visualization of key trends and patterns.

## Future Work

- Extend the analysis to include advanced predictive models.
- Optimize feature selection and engineering for better accuracy.
- Explore additional datasets for broader generalization.
